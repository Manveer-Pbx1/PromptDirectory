## About

**PromptDirectory** is a simple platform for managing AI prompts. It provides a RESTful API to create, read, update, and delete prompts. All prompts are public—no authentication or user models involved. This is an open-source tool with future potential to include LLM-driven prompt suggestions.

## Features

- View all community prompts  
- Add new prompts  
- Update prompts by ID  
- Delete prompts by ID  
- Public and open-source

## Tech Stack Used

- **Backend:** Django (Python)
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Frontend:** HTML + TailwindCSS
- **Others:** Django REST Framework

## Database Integration

This project uses **MongoDB** as the backend database to store prompts.

- Integration is handled using the `pymongo` library to connect the MONGODB Client using the Database name and the connection URL (localhost:27017 for local)

## Running the Tests
The application uses `pytest` as the main testing framework along with `pytest-django, unittest.mock, and Django's Test Client` for Django integration, mocking, and simulating HTTP requests respectively.

To run the tests, do the following:
1. Navigate to the root folder
```
  cd API/API/promptDirectory
```
2. Run the command (with coverage):
```
  pytest --cov=prompts --cov-report=term-missing
```

This is the final coverage report (74%) that is obtained:
